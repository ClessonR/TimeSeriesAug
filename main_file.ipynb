    "Sentence-Level Augmentation: Perform augmentation at the sentence level by shuffling, inserting, or deleting sentences.\n",
    "Semantic Augmentation: Apply semantic-preserving transformations such as synonym replacement and contextual word embeddings.\n",
    "2. Supported NLP Tasks:\n",
    "Text Classification: Augment text data to enhance the performance of classification models.\n",
    "Text Generation: Diversify text generation tasks by generating multiple variations of input sequences.\n",

    "Simple API: Straightforward API design for easy integration into existing NLP pipelines and workflows.\n",
    "Support for Various Frameworks: Compatible with popular NLP frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.\n",
    "4. Customization and Extensibility:\n",
    "Custom Augmentation Functions: Flexibility to define custom augmentation functions tailored to specific use cases.\n",

    "BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n",
    "BERT is a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model developed by researchers at Google. It stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT has achieved remarkable performance across various NLP tasks by leveraging the power of transformer-based architectures and pre-training techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "1. Bidirectional Contextual Representations:\n",
    "Bidirectional: BERT captures contextual information from both left and right contexts of each word in a sentence, enabling a deeper understanding of text.\n",
    "Contextual: The model generates contextualized word representations by considering the entire input sequence, resulting in more accurate representations.\n",
    "2. Transformer Architecture:\n",
    "Attention Mechanism: BERT employs self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies effectively.\n",
    "Transformer Blocks: BERT consists of multiple transformer blocks, each containing multi-head self-attention and feedforward neural network layers.\n",
    "3. Pre-training and Fine-tuning:\n",
    "Pre-training: BERT is pre-trained on large-scale text corpora using unsupervised learning objectives, such as masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP).\n",
    "Fine-tuning: After pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks with task-specific labeled data, enabling transfer learning and adaptation to specific tasks.\n",
    "4. Versatility and Performance:\n",
    "Versatility: BERT has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification, named entity recognition (NER), question answering, and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "Multilingual Support: BERT models are available in multiple languages, facilitating NLP tasks in diverse linguistic contexts."
